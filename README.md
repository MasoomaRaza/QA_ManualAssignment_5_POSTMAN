# QA_ManualAssignment_5_POSTMAN

As part of my QA internship at 10Pearls, I completed a Postman assignment where I created and organized API collections using one of the provided testing APIs. I worked with all major HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), set the base URL as an environment variable, and generated random data for request bodies. I parsed JSON response bodies and logged specific property values to the Postman Console. I used Postmanâ€™s Chai Assertion Library to validate response data, wrote both passing and intentionally failing assertions, and handled variable manipulation through Pre-request and Tests scripts. Additionally, I chained API requests by capturing values from one response and using them in the next call, running both APIs together successfully as a collection.
